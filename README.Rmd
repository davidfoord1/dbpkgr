# dbpkgr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

dbpkgr seeks to turn a database connection into a temporary R package to provide a set of convenience functions. Each created package supplies the following functions for the given connection:

- `_structure()` retrieves data.frame of catolog, schema and table names from information_schema.tables.
- `_list_schemas()` retrieves a character vector of schema names available.
- `_list_tables()` retrieves a character vector of table names available.
- `_query()` takes a SQL string and retrieves the result as a data.frame.

It is designed to work best where an `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` is provided by the connection database management system (DBMS). Once the package is created you don't need to handle the connection object anymore.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dbpkgr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("davidfoord1/dbpkgr")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(dbpkgr)
```

A demo with a database in memory:
```{r cars}
connection <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")
DBI::dbWriteTable(connection, "mtcars", mtcars)
DBI::dbWriteTable(connection, "iris", iris)
```

Set up the package with a single function call, supplying the connection and package name:

```{r package}
dbp_package(connection, "mydb")
```

The name will be used as a prefix for auto-complete friendly functions, with which you can get information from the connection:

```{r list_tables}
mydb_list_tables()
```

Or retrieve raw SQL query results:

```{r query}
mydb_query("SELECT cyl, COUNT(cyl) AS count FROM mtcars GROUP BY cyl")
```

Basic documentation is automatically generated for the temporary package, e.g. provided by:

```{r structure, eval=FALSE}
?mydb_structure
```
